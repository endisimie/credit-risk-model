📘 Credit Scoring Business Understanding
🔍 How does the Basel II Accord’s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?
The Basel II Capital Accord mandates that financial institutions quantify credit risk rigorously and maintain capital reserves proportionate to their risk exposure. Specifically, it encourages the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach, which requires institutions to:

Build transparent and explainable models

Validate models regularly

Document modeling logic, assumptions, and performance

This regulatory framework places strong emphasis on interpretability and auditability. As a result, models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) are often preferred—even at the cost of some predictive performance—because they:

📝 Enable clear documentation and communication

⚖️ Align with fairness and transparency standards

🧪 Are easier to validate and stress test than black-box models

🧩 Why do we need a proxy target variable, and what are the risks?
Our dataset lacks a direct default label, which is essential for supervised learning. Therefore, we create a proxy variable to simulate high-risk behavior using heuristics such as:

❌ No repeat purchases within 90 days

📉 Low frequency or monetary activity (RFM patterns)

🚫 Missed or late payments

While this enables early model development, it introduces several business risks:

⚠️ Label noise: May misclassify good customers as bad (or vice versa), harming model precision

🧱 Bias risk: If the proxy is based on unfair rules, it may discriminate against certain customer groups

💼 Business misalignment: The proxy may not reflect actual financial losses, resulting in incorrect lending decisions

🛠️ Ongoing validation with domain experts and real repayment data is essential to refine this proxy.

| Criteria                   | Simple Model (Logistic Regression + WoE)    | Complex Model (Gradient Boosting / XGBoost)    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Interpretability**       | ✅ High – easily explainable to stakeholders | ❌ Low – needs tools like SHAP/LIME             |
| **Predictive Power**       | ❌ Moderate – may miss non-linear patterns   | ✅ High – captures complex interactions         |
| **Deployment**             | ✅ Easy to validate and monitor              | ❌ Requires MLOps and explainability tools      |
| **Regulatory Fit**         | ✅ Strong compliance and auditability        | ⚠️ Needs extra documentation and justification |
| **Stability & Robustness** | ✅ Less prone to overfitting                 | ⚠️ Sensitive to data drift, needs tuning       |


🎯 Final Thoughts
In regulated industries like banking, transparency and accountability often outweigh raw predictive performance. Therefore:

🏛️ Logistic Regression with WoE is widely adopted for credit scoring due to its balance of accuracy, fairness, and regulatory acceptance.

🚀 Gradient Boosting models can enhance prediction in pre-screening or be integrated with explainability layers (e.g., SHAP) for compliant usage.
